Hello!

This project uses bike sharing data from [Divvy](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data) to visualize data in R. Some of the main tools being used are RStudio, flexdashboard, leaflet for R, the tidyverse, and ggplot2.

The various parts of this project are as follows:
1. [Data procurement](https://zacklarsen.github.io/divvy/Data.html)
1. [Exploratory data analysis](https://zacklarsen.github.io/divvy/EDA.html)
1. [Flexdashboard](https://zacklarsen.github.io/divvy/Flex.html)
1. [Station demand forecasting model](https://zacklarsen.github.io/divvy/Model.html)


Flexdashboards are RMarkdown documents that can be converted to HTML files, allowing you to create a dashboard of visualizations or even storyboards to showcase your data. They are similar in some respects to Tableau dashboards but they also allow some more customization and the full power of R for data preprocessing, analysis, statistics, machine learning modeling, and visualization.
